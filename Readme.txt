Measure Quality of Network

<<< For using NguyenLeMinhHoa.py >>>
    - This file is to define Fuzzy sets and functions on fuzzy spaces
    - Already import into NguyenLeMinhHoa2.py and NguyenLeMinhHoa3.py also

Now you could choose 2 python file below to run
<<< For using NguyenLeMinhHoa2.py to run the app>>>
    Step 1: Run python file and type the input that you are expecting:
    - Type the number of spam mail from zero to ten thousand (0-10000)
    - Type the rate of delay message from zero to one hundred (0-100) by percentage
    - Type the network speed from one to one hundred (1-100)
    Step 2: After fuzzy model compute completely, the output will be printed out screen

<<< For using NguyenLeMinhHoa3.py to test the fuzzy app (For testing only)>>>
    Step 1: Run python file and type the number of random test for fuzzy app
    Another parameters such as speed of network, number of spam mail or delay message ratio will be randomized
    Step 2: After fuzzy model compute completely, the result will be saved in my_test.txt file
    You can open and read the summary testcases at the end of file


Thanks for using my application.
